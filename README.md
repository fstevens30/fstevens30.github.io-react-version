# Portfolio site using React

## Description

This is a rebuild of my previous [portfolio site](https://github.com/fstevens30/fstevens30.github.io) using React.

I did this to sharpen my React skills as well as because the codebase for the previous site was a mess becasue I kept adding more and more features to it.

## Layout

The site layout will be mostly identical to the previous site, but with a few changes, these include:

- The site will only have one page, that conatins all the content.
- The navigation will be reworked to take up less space and fit the one page theme better.
- The hero section will take up the entire view when the page is loaded. 
- I **NEED** to get a better picture of myself for the hero section.
- Dark mode will be integrated.
